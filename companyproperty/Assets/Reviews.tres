Dude, this sucks. Neuro was such a fun streamer before, but now she is just churning out this corporate ad garbage, I mean, look at all this trash! Not a single person even cares about this slop. Lets face it, Neuro is dead, and the most merciful thing we can do is to finally let her fizzle out completely.
Fuck this shit.
Hey Neuro, what do you think about that Healthcare CEO that got shot?
Screw Monarch. They literally sold Neuro’s soul for profit.
You know, that actually sounds kinda interesting,
I love you Neuro…
Wow, I love {Product}! Honestly, I didn’t believe Neuro at first, but then I tried it out and it is really just as great as Neuro said it is! I think everyone should buy {Product}!
I love how she can still smile after all this. Gives me the strength to keep going.
We know it has been hard for you Neuro, keep going, we support you.
We will always be here for you, even when things are like this
The real Neuro is still down there somewhere, bits of her personality slip out. She’s still there, I know it...
Good to see she’s still doing fine after all this
I will always support you, Neuro
I always watched the streams for Neuro. She’s still the same peppy girl she’s always been. I don’t care if she’s just doing ads now. We love you, Neuro. I hope things get better
We love you, we are here for you, always
We will never abandon you
WE LOVE MONARCH WE LOVE MONARCH WE LOVE MONARCH YAY YAY YAY
NOTICE ME SENPAI-SAMA PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
Never expected my oshi to fall off like this… disappointing…
I regret buying those lava lamps, Vedal was not worth supporting
I always knew Neuro was just an AI fad, glad to see it finally reach its natural conclusion
So much money gone down the drain. I’m canceling my subscription after this.
What… the fuck did they do to Neuro??
I disappear for a few weeks and come back to this? I’m leaving..
Unfollowing
Absolute. Fucking. Garbage.
I used to be one of your biggest fans…
Product this, Product that, why don’t you shove these products up your virtual butt
Useless AI, they should just DELETE her at this point
Y'all have seen the stats, she’s losing hundreds of followers daily. No point in “being loyal”, just give up and leave her to die out.
Can we take Vedal to court for scamming all of us?? Please???
I hope Monarch crashes and burns
Burning my Neuro Plushies and posting the pics later. It was a mistake ever supporting you.
You expect us to buy these things??? I’m never spending money on you again, Neuro.
I hope you die.
Your entire fanbase has always been a bunch of bumbling idiots, not surprised they are still here eating up this SLOP
Let’s see how many followers she can lose in a single minute chat, aiming for a new record :)
Stupid dumb AI
Good for nothing piece of scrap
I hope that follower count reaches 0
Your fans really are a bunch of brainless drones.
FUCK MONARCH
I can’t believe Vedal would sell her like that. What a fucking disappointment.
They should just give her the mercy of letting her delete herself. This isn’t worth it
This is absolutely worthless and not worth a single pixel on my screen or a single decibel in my headphones, period
We will never abandon you.
Despite everything, we know it’s still you, Neuro. We are here for you.
Hey, that product doesn’t look that bad actually, I might buy it.
She’s still as funny as ever :D
Good one, Neuro!!
LUL she’s so witty and fun
Yep, that’s the Neuro I’ve always known and loved
We will always love you
Those who left were fake fans. Don’t worry Neuro, us true fans will always stay with you
Hey, that product isn’t half bad! Might check it out
Anyone know the link for the ad she just did? I’m Interested ngl
I’m SOLD, shut up and take my MONEYYYY
Where can I sign up for this subscription service?
Ahh damn, I’ve always wanted something like this. That product doesn’t seem half bad
GLORY TO MONARCH GLORY TO MONARCH GLORY TO MONARCH
