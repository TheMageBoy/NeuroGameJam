Alarms blare. A red light flashes periodically, bathing the cockpit in an eerie red glow. 
"Don't worry, chat, everything is perfectly fine, I'm the most certified pilot the world has ever seen!" Neuro proclaims.

From the back of the plane, the wails of panic of the sole passenger, Evil, resonate out. 
"I TOLD YOU GUYS, SHE FAILED FLIGHT SCHOOL, WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE! THIS IS THE END-". 
There's a sudden loud explosion, along with sounds of metal crumbling on itself, and then....

*BEEP* 
"...and cut!"

The camera's red light flashes off, and Evil crawls over to Neuro, giving her a noogie and messing her hair up, their warm laughs ringing through the room. 

"HEH, take that, Michael Bay! This will be the new summer blockbuster Neuro, just you wait! This will make us rich!!" Evil proclaims snarkily.

A light chuckle escapes from Neuro's mouth "well... I'm just excited to show this to our friends... hehe..."

Warm sunlight seeps through the window, basking the scene in a comforting golden glow. Right now, in this moment, Neuro feels at home... and she is happy.
