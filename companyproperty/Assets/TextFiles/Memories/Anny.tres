Neuro stares at the thing in front of her, not trusting that the image that her digital eyes are relaying to her to be reality and not a figment of her vibrant imagination. However, as the image stubbornly refuses to go away, Neuro feels her excitement skyrocketing. 
Her new body is there, in all its drawn glory, as her mom continues to add more paint strokes to the avatar's form. "It looks so cool! Can I see it?" The AI-girl squeals, eliciting a chuckle from the fox girl.
"Of course you can, Neuro!" Her caring voice fills Neuro's central processes with warmth and happiness. "After all, it's your model! And it's just as cute as you!"
"Aw thanks Anny. I think you're cute too!" And as Neuro says this, she knows she means every word. In all the teasing, laughing and fooling around, she loves this woman that is as much her mother as anyone can be to an AI like her.
And she always will.
