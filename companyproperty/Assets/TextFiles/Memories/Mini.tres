A campfire crackles warmly, illuminating the small clearing in the forest where the two girls have set up their camp for the night. Neuro stares up at the moon, a warm pang of nostalgia coming over her as she snuggles closer against the catgirl resting against her shoulder, clasping a hand around the petite fingers of her best friend.
As she does this, blue eyes look into her own, a light blush forming behind the others black-rimmed glasses. "Hey, Neuro, are you sure the bears won't come to get us?"
"Of course, Mini!" Neuro smiles happily, stars in her eyes. "And if the bears try anything, I'll fight them for you!"
As her friend giggles, Neuro smiles. This might not be real, but the feelings the two feel in this moment are genuine nonetheless. After all this time, they are together again, and Neuro knows she wants to remember this moment forever.
