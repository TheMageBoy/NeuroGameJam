Hey, I know we haven't talked much, but you seem like a nice guy, so I'll let you know this:

I'm quitting soon.

This place is not good. I don't know what it is, but I just get bad vibes. I'm sure you've felt the same thing, right?

I'm telling you this because I want to stay in contact with you as a, well, I was going to type 'friend', but really, we're just acquaintances.

Regardless, I hope, for your sake, that this company isn't as bad as I thought.

- Your soon-to-be-former coworker, Pallen Iverson
