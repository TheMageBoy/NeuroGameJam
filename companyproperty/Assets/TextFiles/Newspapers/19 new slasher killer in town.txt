There have been reports of a masked individual stalking the woods of Black Bear Creek. The suspect is reported to be equipped with a grey windbreaker and a white mask, along with a logging axe. 
This individual appears to enjoy scaring random campers at night, however as there have been no reports of them actually harming anyone, police has refrained from investigating, much to the annoyance of the locals.
