MEMO TO EMPLOYEES OF THIS SECTOR

I don't want any more talk about the "goop incident". We know it was a mess, we know it traumatized everyone. We're having a routine sanitary checkup, so I want no mentions of the "goop incident". 

If anyone asks about the nature of the "goop incident" tell them that "The 'goop incident' never happened,there is no such thing".
