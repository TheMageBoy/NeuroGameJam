LAVA LAMPS SHOPS CLEANED OUT!
===
This week, a bunch of lava lamps were bought up en masse all over the city. According to residents, two trucks came to each store during the week. Every day, the route of the trucks after the "cleaning" of the store was different. Apparently, these mass buyers did not want to be spotted.

It looks like lava lamps will have to be ordered from other cities in the near future.
