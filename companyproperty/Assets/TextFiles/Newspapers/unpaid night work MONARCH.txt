Attention Employees!

MONARCH   ON OUR WINGS RESTS THE FUTURE
Attention employees! Due to an unexpected incident in the neighboring complex we are now severely behind schedule. As a result all employees are required to stay the night today. We hope you forgive us for this inconvenience. Of course, as stated in your contracts, there will be no additional pay for the time worked overtime.
Have a productive day, and remember: You are the wings that make MONARCH soar!
