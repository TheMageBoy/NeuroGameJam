Please remember to WIPE any sensitive data from your personal computer in the case that position rotates.

I'm tired of having to REPEAT this to all of you. If I see another incident of this kind, I'm getting higher management involved. 

We can NOT have old files sitting around in the same PC, last thing we need is *another* data leak.
