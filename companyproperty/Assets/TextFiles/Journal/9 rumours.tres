Today, I accidentally walked in the wrong room. I didn't know what was happening in there, but there was a bunch of people in suits talking about something, probably some important company stuff I don't know about.

But, that's not the strangest part, if it was just that, I wouldn't be writing this. After that happened, all of my coworkers seems to be avoiding me for some reason. Well, not all of them, the newer recruits were still treating me as usual, but all the older ones have practically disassociated with me. What's up with that?
