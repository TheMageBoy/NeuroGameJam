I talked too much. I talked too much and now I'm getting fired.

I shouldn't have blabbed about that freaking rumor. I get why everyone is so quiet now. Talking gets you nothing. I probably should've deleted that journal entry too, but it's too late now.

I'm not deleting this. I'm keeping this for other people who joins this company and comes across this particular computer, like that other guy. Get out while you can.
