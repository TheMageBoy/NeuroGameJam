Today, someone quit. It's becoming a rather common occurrence. The turnover rate here is insane, and they're hiring tons to compensate. I barely knew anyone here, and that number is looking to dwindle, considering the ones I actually knew are now gone. I've considered doing the same. Quitting, that is. But the money speaks for itself.
