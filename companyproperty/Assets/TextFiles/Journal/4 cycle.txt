It feels weird to be saying this, but I feel like I've seen the entire employee life-cycle at this place, despite the short time I've been here.

People typically come in excited for the pay, then it literally feels like the life is drained out of them as time goes on until they eventually quit. I'm imagining this building as a vampire feeding on its inhabitants lifeforce. Honestly might not be too far from the truth.
