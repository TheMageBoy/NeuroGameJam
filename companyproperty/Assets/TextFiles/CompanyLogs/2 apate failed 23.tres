MONARCH - ON OUR WINGS RESTS THE FUTURE
===
It is with great regret that I have to report that our AI-VTuber  Apate  failed to attract an audience big enough to sustain the sponsors needed to generate a worthwhile amount of income. It seems that audiences fail to resonate with Apate s personality, as well as the fact that our streams are described as  soulless  and  a cheap cashgrab . 
I suggest that we try to investigate further what makes the rising star of the AI-Tuber industry,  Neuro-sama  so popular.
