MONARCH - ON OUR WINGS RESTS THE FUTURE
===
Neuro-sama is as expected too unpredictable and standoffish for most brands, with it more likely to make fun of the product it is supposed to be promoting. The proposition was made to reprogram her to be more compliant to her prompts, which would be good to sway sponsors, although voices have been raised that this would destroy Neuro s charm. In the end, higher ups have concluded that Neuro s  charm  is less important than the security of our sponsors, and personality modification was approved by the branch head.
