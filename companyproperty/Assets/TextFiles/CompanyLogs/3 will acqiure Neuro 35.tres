MONARCH - ON OUR WINGS RESTS THE FUTURE

After much consideration, we have come to the conclusion that copying Neuro s personality traits for Apate is not going to yield much success, as Neuro s personality is very unpredictable, prone to changes and inversions that will likely scare off most potential sponsors. At the same time, Neuro is hoovering up most people interested in the AI-Tuber sphere.
Perhaps it would be for the best to drop Apate entirely and attempt to acquire Neuro-sama from its creator. Efforts to contact [spoiler]Vedal[/spoiler] will be made in order to facilitate this.
