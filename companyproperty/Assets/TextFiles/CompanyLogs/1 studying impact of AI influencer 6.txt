MONARCH - ON OUR WINGS RESTS THE FUTURE
===
Surveying the potential impact and profitability of an artificial influencer shows promising results, as they do not require pay or other things, do not take time off or anything else, and are almost as good (if not more so) as their human counterparts. If we are able to create our own AI-streamer and get it decently popular, then the amount of money we can earn from sponsorships is promising to be one of our most profitable ventures yet.
